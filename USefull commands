# Daily Manouvers

## Create Permanent Alias
### Open .bashrc (The .bashrc file is a script file thatâ€™s executed when a user logs in. The file itself contains a series of configurations for the terminal session.) 
$ [text editor] ~/.bashrc
### Modify the file so it would include the new alias adding:
alias [command alias]='[command to be aliased]'
